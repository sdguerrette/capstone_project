## data sources:

- https://github.com/KFFData/COVID-19-Data - link to KFF covid data, lots of good info on trends, state actions, disparities by race, etc.

- https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ - presidential election results by county - interesting to overlay with covid county data?



## project ideas:
- USA county analysis to predict severity of epidemic outbreak by using Covid 19 data and county demographic data. analysis could included:
	- county population
	- race demographics
 	- age demographics
	- covid deaths
	- covid cases
	- political leaning (by county pres. election results)
	- vaccination rate
	-
