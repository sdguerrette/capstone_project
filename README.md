Hi Guys
In a little bit, I will be uploading the partial Dashboard. It is just a start. We will talk about it but going forward it will be easy to correct, add-on and redo completely. I have gotten the hang of it.

Here is thr URL Image of the dash Board

Hi Guys
Guys, I have just posted/uploaded the Tableau image of the Dash Board.  What I was able to achieve today covers the Death by State, The Rates  by minority, disabled and the elderly.  Unfortunately, I could not fish out the Vaccines (i am not saying it is not there, i could find it ) and I was rushing to sketch something prior to class.  It is just a sketch.
