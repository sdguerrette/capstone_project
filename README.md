## Topic
-using county population demographics, vulnerability data, and social context data to predict the case rate of covid-19 over the first year of the virus (march 2020-march 2021). 
- a successful model may help us predict which counties would be most vulnerable to a new infection disease

## Data Sources
- US census: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2021/counties/totals/
- Social Context for Understanding a Region: https://www.statsamerica.org/downloads/default.aspx
- social vulnerability index(SVI): https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/
- Case Time Series Data - Johns Hopkins University: https://github.com/govex/COVID-19



## overview of project steps
1. load csv files into SQL database
2. Perform table joins using database language
3. read files from SQL to python
4. use pandas to explore and preprocess the data
5. write processed tables back to new SQL table
6. separate features from targets
7. decide on ML model (supervised, unsupervised, or neural network)
8. scale data if needed
9. create ML model and feed the data to it
10. analyze and explore results of the analysis
11. optimize data and ML model
12. create presentation in google slides?
13. create visualization dashboard in Tableau?

## Communication Protocols
- main communication through Slack channel
- collaborative work done via Zoom 
<<<<<<< HEAD
- emergency communication via slack DM as needed

Hi Guys
In a little bit, I will be uploading the partial Dashboard. It is just a start. We will talk about it but going forward it will be easy to correct, add-on and redo completely. I have gotten the hang of it.

Here is thr URL Image of the dash Board

See in class




Hi Guys
Guys, I have just posted/uploaded the Tableau image of the Dash Board.  What I was able to achieve today covers the Death by State, The Rates  by minority, disabled and the elderly.  Unfortunately, I could not fish out the Vaccines (i am not saying it is not there, i could find it ) and I was rushing to sketch something prior to class.  It is just a sketch.
