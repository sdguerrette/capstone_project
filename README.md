# ML Goals:
## Integrate the following ML models:
 - logistic regression 
 - Naive Bayes
 - Multilayer perception 
 - Random Forest
 
## Goals:
- Target: Cases (in the future, if possible, deaths as well by county)
    - get min, max, average
- Get all the dates for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic
- Getting daily increases and moving averages
- identify feature importance with census and SVI data
- Future forecasting ( need to modify the data to fit the model better as regressions  cannot pick the pattern )

# New ML Goals 08/03
## Integrate the following ML models:
 - logistic regression 
 - NN 
 
## Goals:
- Target = total deaths
- identify feature importance with census and SVI data
- identify top states in death rate and the most influencial features
- compare with more current covid death data to view any differences (EX, Deaths till  March 2021 vs Deaths till March 2022)
