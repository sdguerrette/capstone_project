Hi Guys
In a little bit, I will be uploading the partial Dashboard. It is just a start. We will talk about it but going forward it will be easy to correct, add-on and redo completely. I have gotten the hang of it.

Here is thr URL Image of the dash Board

Hi Guys
Guys, I have just posted/uploaded the Tableau image of the Dash Board.  What I was able to achieve today covers the Death by State, The Rates  by minority, disabled and the elderly.  Unfortunately, I could not fish out the Vaccines (i am not saying it is not there, i could find it ) and I was rushing to sketch something prior to class.  It is just a sketch.

### SVI Analysis 8/6
Hi all - I have done some additional analysis on the SVI data.  I uploaded a new file with a second tab that has the data dictionary with definitions.  It has some very interesting data - the file is really divided into four sections  First section is the social data for four categories of vulnerability by county/state.  The second section is the percentage of people for each of the factors from Section 1.  The third section is the percntile ranks based on the factors.  The fourth section are adjunct variables of uninsured by county/state.   Have a look at the file and we can talk about if this helps modeling definition to work with these in more depth.
