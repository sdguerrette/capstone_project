# capstone_project

## Topic
- using state/county demographics, population risk factors, covid-19 case rates, and covid 19 death rates to predict whether a state or county is at high risk of an infectious disease.
- we selected this topic as we were all interested in the health field, and there is a preponderance of data regarding covid-19 over the last 3 years.

## Data Sources
- KFF.org
- John Hopkins University
- U.S. census data



## overview of project steps
1. load csv files into SQL database
2. Perform table joins using database language
3. read files from SQL to python
4. use pandas to explore and preprocess the data
5. write processed tables back to new SQL table
6. separate features from targets
7. decide on ML model (supervised, unsupervised, or neural network)
8. scale data if needed
9. create ML model and feed the data to it
10. analyze and explore results of the analysis
11. optimize data and ML model


## Communication Protocols
- main communication through Slack channel
- collaborative work done via Zoom 
- emergency communication via slack DM as needed
