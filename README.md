## Data files Updated 7/30

1.  covid_atrisk_by_state.csv  - This file has population numbers, age risk population(over 65), health risk percentages of population.   Population numbers are from 2018 - health risk percentages are from 2020.  Sources of data are KFF.org

2.  population_distribution.csv - This file contains the distribution of the US population by percentage for age buckets 0-18, 19-25, 26-34, 35-54, 55-64, 65+ as of 2019.



The data available at KFF.org spans 2018 - 2020.  There is a potential that the population numbers are disconnected but this is likely not material to the analysis.  The percentage of people with health risks likely did not materially change from 2018 to 2020 excluding Covid.
